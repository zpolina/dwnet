# DwNet

### UPDATE: The implementation is now hosted at the **UBC Computer Vision Lab** official [GitHub repository](https://github.com/UBC-Computer-Vision-Group/DwNet).

An implementation of the BMVC2019 paper "DwNet: Dense warp-based network for pose-guided human video generation".
In this paper, we focus on human motion transfer â€“ generation of a video depicting a particular subject, observed in a single image, performing a series of motions exemplified by an auxiliary (driving) video.

## Here are some of our results on the newly introduced fashion dataset:
